Pyletron Builder allows you to create desktop applications using HTML, CSS and Javascript. It is based off the Python Library pywebview and can be used by many web apps for example, it is possible to compile GDevelop games with Pyletron.

It is lightweight and takes less storage however doesn't have anything nodejs related, and it's also an alternative to Electron.

*Note: The 'pyletronIcon.ico' file needs to be in the same directory as build.exe/build.bat for it to run.*
